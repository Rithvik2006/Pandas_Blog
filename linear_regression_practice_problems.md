## 1. Predicting House Price

Suppose you collect data:

| House Size (sq ft) | Price (₹ in lakhs) |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1000               | 50 |
| 1500               | 65 |
| 2000               | 80 |
| 2500               | 95 |

**Question:** What price would you predict for a house of 1800 sq ft?

## 2. Predicting Calories Burned

A dataset shows:

| Minutes of Running | Calories Burned |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| 10                 | 100 |
| 20                 | 210 |
| 30                 | 320 |
| 40                 | 430 |

**Question:** If someone runs for 25 minutes, how many calories would you predict?

| 3     | 5.0 L |
| 4     | 6.1 L |

**Question:** Predict the salary of someone with 3.5 years of experience.
